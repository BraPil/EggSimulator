## Identification Process

### 1. Define Information Need

- What specific knowledge is required?
- What level of detail is needed?
- What format is most useful?

### 2. Search Available Resources

- Consult `indexes/reference_material_index.md`
- Search official documentation
- Look for authoritative sources

### 3. Evaluate Quality

For each potential reference:

- **Authority**: Is the source authoritative?
- **Currency**: Is it up to date?
- **Relevance**: Does it address our specific need?
- **Completeness**: Does it cover the topic fully?

### 4. Document and Index

- Record useful references
- Update `indexes/reference_material_index.md`
- Note how the reference was used

## Priority Order

1. Official documentation (highest priority)
2. Established standards bodies
3. Well-maintained community resources
4. Educational materials
5. General web resources (lowest priority)
