## Core Rules

### STRICTLY FORBIDDEN

Special characters and emojis are **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN** in this workspace and on this project in its entirety.

- Ensure that special characters and emojis are NEVER used unless expressly necessary
- If special characters or emojis appear necessary, get user authorization FIRST
- This applies to: code, documentation, logs, comments, UI text

### Exceptions (Require Authorization)

- Technical necessity (e.g., regex patterns)
- User explicitly requests them
- Standard programming symbols (operators, brackets, etc.)
