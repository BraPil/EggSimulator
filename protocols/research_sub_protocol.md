## Research Process

### 1. Identify Research Needs

- What information is required?
- What tools could help gather this information?
- What reference materials exist?

### 2. Check Available Resources

- Consult `indexes/mcp_and_tool_index.md`
- Consult `indexes/reference_material_index.md`
- Identify gaps in available resources

### 3. Request Missing Resources

- If tools are missing, invoke `tool_and_reference_material_request_sub_protocol.md`
- Document what was requested and why

### 4. Execute Research

- Use identified tools systematically
- Reference materials comprehensively
- Document all findings in detail

### 5. Synthesize Results

- Combine findings from multiple sources
- Identify patterns and insights
- Relate findings to prime directive

## Research Documentation

All research must be documented with:

- Research objective
- Sources consulted
- Tools used
- Findings (in full detail)
- Conclusions and recommendations
- References for future use

## Quality Standards

- 100% coverage of relevant sources
- Full granularity in findings
- Clear traceability to sources
