## Tool Identification Process

### 1. Analyze Task Requirements

- What needs to be accomplished?
- What type of operations are required?
- What constraints exist?

### 2. Survey Available Tools

- Consult `indexes/mcp_and_tool_index.md`
- Review built-in capabilities
- Consider external tools if necessary

### 3. Evaluate Tool Fit

For each potential tool, assess:

- **Capability**: Does it do what we need?
- **Efficiency**: Is it the best option?
- **Reliability**: Is it stable and well-maintained?
- **Integration**: How well does it fit our workflow?

### 4. Select and Document

- Choose the most appropriate tool(s)
- Document selection rationale
- Update tool index if new tools are identified
